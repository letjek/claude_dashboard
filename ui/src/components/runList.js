// Pure, framework-free helpers for reconciling the live rail's run list against the SSE stream and
// the initial REST snapshot (`GET /api/runs`). Kept dependency-free from React and from the app
// shell so the subtle merge/race logic can be exercised directly in a unit test, independent of
// rendering.
//
// The stream opens before the snapshot request resolves (it goes through the daemon and a disk
// read), so an event for a run can arrive first. When the snapshot then lands, it must not
// overwrite what the stream already reported — the snapshot is a picture of an earlier moment.

// A run id is `${sessionId}:${toolUseId}` — the correlator builds it that way so a dispatch can be
// matched from either end. The session's own progress events are keyed by the tool_use id alone, so
// splitting it back out here is what lets a rail row show what its subagent is doing. Split on the
// first colon: a session id is a uuid and never contains one, while nothing guarantees that of a
// tool_use id.
